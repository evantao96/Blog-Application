Exercise Title: Blog Application

Description: The candidate is tasked with building a simple blog application using Ruby on Rails 7. The application should allow users to create, view, edit, and delete blog posts. Each blog post should have a title, content, and a publication date. Users should also be able to leave comments on blog posts.

Requirements:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication using the Devise gem or a similar authentication solution. Users should be able to sign up, sign in, and sign out.
Blog Posts:
Users should be able to create, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
Blog posts should display the title, content, and publication date.
Users should be able to view a list of all blog posts.
Users should be able to view a single blog post along with its comments.
Comments:
Users should be able to leave comments on blog posts.
Comments should display the user's name (if logged in), timestamp, and content.
Users should be able to edit and delete their own comments.
Validation: Implement appropriate validation to ensure that blog posts have titles and content, and comments have content.
Testing: Write unit tests and/or integration tests for the critical parts of the application, such as user authentication, creating blog posts, and leaving comments.
Styling: Apply basic styling to make the application visually appealing. You can use Tailwind.
Deployment: The code should work on a local host. Provide a link to your Git repo.
